            <h2>Incident Status Summary (ICS209)</h2>
            <p align="left"><strong>Purpose:</strong>
                <br/>
                To support the needs of the incident, the Incident Status Summary (ICS 209) collects basic incident decision support information at the incident level.
                It is the primary mechanism for reporting incident decision support information above the incident level to incident coordination and support organizations, including agency/organizational managers and executives.
                As such, the ICS 209 contains basic information elements needed to support decision making at all levels above the incident to support the incident.
                Decisionmakers may include the agency having jurisdiction, but also all multiagency coordination system (MACS) elements and parties, such as cooperating and assisting agencies/organizations, 
                dispatch centers, emergency operations centers, administrators, elected officials, and local, tribal, county, State, and Federal agencies.  Once ICS 209 information has been submitted from the incident,
                decisionmakers and others at all incident support and coordination points may transmit and share the information (based on its sensitivity and appropriateness) for access and use at local, regional, State,
                and national levels as it is needed to facilitate support. 
                <br/>
                Accurate and timely completion of the ICS 209 is necessary to identify appropriate resource needs, determine allocation of limited resources when multiple incidents occur,
                and secure additional capability when there are limited resources due to constraints of time, distance, or other factors. The information included on the ICS 209 influences the
                priority of the incident, and thus its share of available resources and incident support.		
                <br/>
                The ICS 209 is used for reporting information on significant incidents. It is not intended for every incident, as most incidents are of short duration and do not require scarce resources,
                significant mutual aid, or additional support and attention. 		
                <br/>
                The ICS 209 is designed to provide a "snapshot in time" to effectively move incident decision support information where it is needed.  It should contain the most accurate and up-to-date
                information available at the time it is prepared. However, readers of the ICS 209 may have access to more up-to-date or real-time information in reference to certain information elements on the ICS 209.
                Coordination among communications and information management elements within ICS and among MACS should delineate authoritative sources for more up-to-date and/or real-time information when ICS 209 information
                becomes outdated in a quickly evolving incident.		
                <br/>
            </p>
            <p align="left"><strong>Reporting Requirements:</strong>
            <br/>
                The ICS 209 is intended to be used when an incident reaches a certain threshold where it becomes significant enough to merit special attention, require additional resource support needs,
                or cause media attention, increased public safety threat, etc.  Agencies or organizations may set reporting requirements and, therefore, ICS 209s should be completed according to each jurisdiction or discipline's policies,
                mobilization guide, or preparedness plans. It is recommended that consistent ICS 209 reporting parameters be adopted and used by jurisdictions or disciplines for consistency over time, documentation, efficiency, trend monitoring,
                incident tracking, etc.		
                <br/>
                For example, an agency or MAC (Multiagency Coordination) Group may require the submission of an initial ICS 209 when a new incident has reached a certain predesignated level of significance,
                such as when a given number of resources are committed to the incident, when a new incident is not completed within a certain timeframe, or when impacts/threats to life and safety reach a given level. 		
                <br/>
                Typically, ICS 209 forms are completed either once daily or for each operational period - in addition to the initial submission. Jurisdictional or organizational guidance may indicate frequency of ICS 209
                submission for particular definitions of incidents or for all incidents. This specific guidance may help determine submission timelines when operational periods are extremely short (e.g., 2 hours) and it is
                not necessary to submit new ICS 209 forms for all operational periods.  		
                <br/>
                Any plans or guidelines should also indicate parameters for when it is appropriate to stop submitting ICS 209s for an incident, based upon incident activity and support levels.
            </p>
            <p align="left"><strong>Preparation:</strong>
            <br/>
            When an Incident Management Organization (such as an Incident Management Team) is in place, the Situation Unit Leader or Planning Section Chief prepares the ICS 209 at the incident.
            On other incidents, the ICS 209 may be completed by a dispatcher in the local communications center, or by another staff person or manager. This form should be completed at the incident
            or at the closest level to the incident.		
            <br/>
            The ICS 209 should be completed with the best possible, currently available, and verifiable information at the time it is completed and signed.  		
            <br/>
            This form is designed to serve incidents impacting specific geographic areas that can easily be defined. It also has the flexibility for use on ubiquitous events, or those events that cover
            extremely large areas and that may involve many jurisdictions and ICS organizations. For these incidents, it will be useful to clarify on the form exactly which portion of the larger incident the ICS 209 is meant to address.
            For example, a particular ICS 209 submitted during a statewide outbreak of mumps may be relevant only to mumps-related activities in Story County, Iowa. This can be indicated in both the incident name, Block 1,
            and in the Incident Location Information section in Blocks 16-26.		
            <br/>
            While most of the "Incident Location Information" in Blocks 16-26 is optional, the more information that can be submitted, the better.  Submission of multiple location indicators increases accuracy,
            improves interoperability, and increases information sharing between disparate systems. Preparers should be certain to follow accepted protocols or standards when entering location information, and clearly
            label all location information. As with other ICS 209 data, geospatial information may be widely shared and utilized, so accuracy is essential.		
            <br/>
            If electronic data is submitted with the ICS 209, do not attach or send extremely large data files. Incident geospatial data that is distributed with the ICS 209 should be in simple incident geospatial basics,
            such as the incident perimeter, point of origin, etc. Data file sizes should be small enough to be easily transmitted through dial-up connections or other limited communications capabilities when ICS 209 information
            is transmitted electronically. Any attached data should be clearly labeled as to format content and collection time, and should follow existing naming conventions and standards.		
            </p>
            <p align="left"><strong>Distruibution:</strong>
            <br/>
            ICS 209 information is meant to be completed at the level as close to the incident as possible, preferably at the incident. Once the ICS 209 has been submitted outside the incident to a dispatch center or MACS element,
            it may subsequently be transmitted to various incident support and coordination entities based on the support needs and the decisions made within the MACS in which the incident occurs.		
            <br/>
            Coordination with public information system elements and investigative/intelligence information organizations at the incident and within MACS is essential to protect information security and to ensure optimal information sharing and coordination.
            There may be times in which particular ICS 209s contain sensitive information that should not be released to the public (such as information regarding active investigations, fatalities, etc.). When this occurs, the ICS 209 (or relevant sections of it)
            should be labeled appropriately, and care should be taken in distributing the information within MACS.  		
            <br/>
            All completed and signed original ICS 209 forms MUST be given to the incident's Documentation Unit and/or maintained as part of the official incident record.
            </p>

            <ul class="a">
                <li>
                    To promote flexibility, only a limited number of ICS 209 blocks are typically required, and most of those are required only when applicable.
                </li>
                <li>Most fields are optional, to allow responders to use the form as best fits their needs and protocols for information collection.  		
                </li>
                <li>For the purposes of the ICS 209, responders are those personnel who are assigned to an incident or who are a part of the response community as defined by NIMS.
                    This may include critical infrastructure owners and operators, nongovernmental and nonprofit organizational personnel, and contract employees (such as caterers),
                    depending on local/jurisdictional/discipline practices.
                </li>
                <li>For additional flexibility only pages 1-3 are numbered, for two reasons:
                    <ul class="a">
                        <li>Possible submission of additional pages for the Remarks Section (Block 47), and</li>
                        <li>Possible submission of additional copies of the fourth/last page (the "Incident Resource Commitment Summary")
                            to provide a more detailed resource summary.</li>
